OctoAcme follows a lightweight, iterative project lifecycle designed to help cross-functional teams deliver customer value quickly and safely. Projects begin with a focused Initiation stage—capture a one-pager that defines the problem, measurable success metrics, stakeholders, and a high-level timeline—then move through Planning (prioritized backlog, estimates, Definition of Done, and a release plan), Execution (sprints, reviews, and demos), Release (staged deployments and smoke checks), and finally Close & Retrospective to document learnings and next steps. Core artifacts include the Project Charter/One-pager, Roadmap/Release Plan, Sprint Backlog, Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done, Risk Register, and Retrospective notes.

Day-to-day work uses a project board as the team’s single source of truth (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined pull request workflow. Backlog items follow a consistent template (title, description, acceptance criteria, priority, estimate, owner) and planning is timeboxed to the sprint length with capacity considered. Pull requests should be small when possible (guideline: ≤ 400 lines), include the linked issue and acceptance criteria, run CI (tests, linting, security scans) before requesting review, and require an approval before merging.

Roles and responsibilities are clearly defined: Project Managers coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications; Product Managers own outcomes, prioritization and success metrics; Developers build and test features; and QA validates acceptance. Risk and dependency management is explicit—teams maintain a Risk Register (ID, impact, likelihood, owner, mitigation) reviewed in weekly syncs and escalate per documented paths when needed. Communication cadence includes daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, PM↔PdM weekly alignment, monthly stakeholder updates, scheduled demos, and templates for weekly status and incident communications.

Quality assurance blends automated and manual checks to keep releases safe and observable. Teams write unit and integration tests, run end-to-end smoke tests for critical flows, include security scanning in CI, and perform manual QA for acceptance when necessary. Pre-release gates require passing CI and security scans, drafted release notes, a rollback/mitigation plan, and prepared smoke tests; deployments favor automated pipelines and include post-deploy verifications and stakeholder announcements.
